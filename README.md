# browser3
An ethreum dapps browser for mobile.

It was built with a slightly modified (hooked-web3-provider and eth-lightwallet) from consensys

I'm reachable at [alvin.browser3@gmail.com](mailto:alvin.browser3@gmail.com)

## For Users
It's available at [getBrowser3.bkfinds.com](https://getBrowser3.bkfinds.com)
Setup is easy, but we cannot retrieve your account if your password is lost, so BE CAREFUL.

It is in testing.

Again, in testing, so put little to no eth for transactions.


## If you're a developer
It is built on:
* [Consensys eth-lightwallet](https://github.com/ConsenSys/eth-lightwallet)
* [Consensys hooked-web3-provider](https://github.com/ConsenSys/hooked-web3-provider)
* [Web3.js The ever relatable](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js)
* Some other common js libraries
* Android and Java

Browser3 is a basic little thing, doesn't even have tabs.

If you can help browser3 would appreciate.
There's dapp testing, haven't really managed much.
I'd appreciate a look into the inner workings, see if there's a security issue
